I will try not to try the exception cases, because my aim to learn the Git, is to get work done in an intermediate level, but not at an expert level. If I were in the programming field, I must have to learn in the master level but for now, as a Data Scientist, I need enough knowledge about git (as I have a lot of stuff in my bag to learn about DS already!)\n",
