# Git-it
*To learn Git, Made with Git, Published on GitHub. Git it.*

## 😲 What is it?
This repository is made for me but I have kept the style in *such a way* that ***anybody who wants to get a quick tour*** with explanation of git
can view this easily.

## ✌️ Why is it?
These notes are taken from the [Version Control with Git — Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/learn/version-control-with-git/) course that I took in the lockdown.
I completed in about *2 weeks* (with the notingdown and stuff). The reason this repository of being here is that, I *(even you!)* can access the concept any time and
***reinforce the knowledge***. 

## 📖 How to read?
I made very **clear division** between all the concepts and new stuff that I learnt through. I *love* markdown. And I found **jupyter notebooks** the best way to note things
down. You need either to *download (clone)* the project or you can *simply view it on GitHub* directly.

**I recommend**: That you to instead use this [JupyterNb Viewer](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/AayushSameerShah/Git-it/tree/main/) site, to render the notebooks in high 
quality and can be viewed on the mobiles too.

This is the *coursera's* course, so the *folders are divided in the weeks*. The concepts are explained in the **incrementive manner**. You should start reading from first week
if you are just trying out. I have made every possible to ***sponge*** the course into this small chunks of notes and easy access without boring long notes.

## 🙏 Tone
I have made these notebooks keeping all public in mind. But the tone is too friendly. I have simulated some chats between us and git to make the concept fun and easy
to understand. You may find some eumephisive words like *WTFun!* but the reason to mention is to grab the attention to the topic rather than making some nonsense rudeness.

Please, give me feedback on this if you find it helpful 👏.

Thanks,<br>
